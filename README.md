# About
A working notebook app with one class: Notebook.
Users can create note, add tag, store note, view all notes or search by tag.

My next steps with this project will be to transform a 'note' into a separate class
from 'notebook'. My rationale behind this is improving scalability. It is likely that,
as the project moves forward, notes may require a number of characteristics which will impact the
quality of the current structure negatively.
