# About
A working notebook app with one class: Notebook.
Users can create note, add tag, store note, view all notes or search by tag.

My next step with this project will be to transform a single 'note' into a separate class. This would improve scalability. It is likely that, if the project were to move forward, notes may require a number of characteristics. These changes would impair the quality of the current structure.
